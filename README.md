Udacity AWS Data Engineer Nanodegree Projects Repository
---

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the Udacity AWS Data Engineer Nanodegree program. This program is designed to teach the core concepts of data engineering using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem.

Each project in this repository demonstrates my ability to use AWS services and tools to solve real-world data engineering problems.

## Projects

The following is a list of projects in this repository:

- Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra: I modeled a NoSQL database for a music streaming app and built an ETL pipeline to load data into it using Python and Apache Cassandra.
- Cloud Data Warehouses: I built an ETL pipeline to extract data from S3, stage it in Redshift, and transform data into a set of dimensional tables for analysis.
- Data Lakes with Spark: I built a data lake in S3, wrote Spark ETL jobs to process data, and built a data warehouse in Redshift.
- Data Pipelines with Airflow: I built a data pipeline using Apache Airflow to automate ETL tasks for a music streaming app.
